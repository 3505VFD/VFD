This spreadsheet program implements the spreadsheet DLLs created from previous assignments.
The UI features a cell name, cell value and cell contents with the latter being editable for input into cells.

The UI does not have much by way of keyboard control. When you select a new cell with the mouse you can enter anything you wish into the input box and press the Enter key to input or press the button.

The backend spreadsheet is not debugged entirely and so some issues with the background logic persist, but the UI works fine. Saving and loading work as they should.
